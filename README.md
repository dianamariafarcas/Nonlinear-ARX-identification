Develop a black-box nonlinear ARX model for an unknown dynamic system, being given two datasets, for identification and validation.
Having a dataset of inputs, it was needed to find the outputs which are generated by an unknown function. To do this, I had to find the best polynomial aproximator of degree m for developing the nonlinear ARX model so that it works in two modes: one-step-ahead prediction and simulation, and then validate the model using the provided validation dataset.
